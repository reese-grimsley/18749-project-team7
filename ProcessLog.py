Each machine should keep a log of its interactions with other processes in the system. This python file is meant to handle those details and expose a simple API

Implementation question: 
    should this be an in-memory data structure like an array? In which case, it should be cleared often.
    Should it be a stored structure like a file? That is slow to index, read, and write from
